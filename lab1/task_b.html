  <body>
    <p>
      P is a tag for new paragraph.
      Paragraphs are usually represented in visual
      media as blocks of text separated from
      adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or
      first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs
      can be any structural grouping of related
      content, such as images or form fields.

    <div>
      Div element has no special meaning at all.
      It represents its children. IT can be used
      with class, lang and title attributes
      to mark up semantics common to a group of
      consecutive elements.
